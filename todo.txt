- Add type based form submission and form submission validation. I.e make sure unix fields are turned into unix timestamps as they share the same input type as regular date columns

- Add a requiredOnly() flag that removes any fields that have default values or are nullable, but also make sure to keep them if the onlyUse() method is also chained
