- Next I will want to rewrite the submit method and make a boilerplate logic handles the submission even with specific data types such as unix timestamps using CarbonPHP and also json_encode json fields and date format again using CarbonPHP

- Add a requiredOnly() flag that removes any fields that have default values or are nullable, but also make sure to keep them if the onlyUse() method is also chained

- Add a fromArray() and fromSchema() function to generate from rather than querying the database
